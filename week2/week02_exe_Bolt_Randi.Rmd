## Problem Set 1

### Exercise 1

What is the type of the following vectors? Explain why they have that type.

 * `c(1, NA+1L, "C")`
 * `c(1L / 0, NA)`
 * `c(1:3, 5)`
 * `c(3L, NaN+1L)`
 * `c(NA, TRUE)`

```{r}
# character takes hierarchy over doubles and integers
print(typeof(c(1, NA+1L, "C")))
# 1L/0 converts to double which takes precedent over  the logical NA
print(typeof(c(1L / 0, NA)))
# doubles takes precedent over 1:3 int
print(typeof(c(1:3, 5)))
# double because NaN+1L is a double which takes precedent over ints
print(typeof(c(3L, NaN+1L)))
# logical bc/both NA and TRUE are logical 
print(typeof(c(NA, TRUE)))

```


### Exercise 2

Use the function `paste` (see `?paste`) to create the following character vectors of length 30:

1. ("label 1", "label 2", ....., "label 30"). 
Note that there is a single space between label and the number following
2. ("fn1", "fn2", ..., "fn30"). In this case, there is no space between fn and the number following

```{r}
paste("label ", 1:30 , sep= "", ",")
paste("fn", 1:30, sep= "")
```



## Problem Set 2

Build a list to represent the following data in R:

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25,
  "address": 
  {
    "streetAddress": "31 3rd Street",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": 10021
  },
  "phoneNumber": 
  [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "212 555-5555"
    },
    {
      "type": "fax",
      "number": "646 555-5555"
    }
  ]
}
```
```{r, error=TRUE}
str(list(firstName = "John", 
         lastName = "Smith", 
         age = 25L, 
         address = list(streetAddress = "31 3rd Street", 
                        city = "New York", 
                        state = "NY", 
                        postalCode = 10021L), 
         phoneNumber = list(type = "home", 
                            number = "212 555 5555"), 
                       list(type = "fax",
                             number = "646 555 5555")))
```



## Problem Set 3

Construct a factor variable (without using `factor`, `as.factor`, or related functions) that contains the weather forecast for Portland over the next 14 days (i.e., excluding today).

<div class="columns-2">

![](weatherfore.png){width=400px}

```{r}
x <- c(2L, 4L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 4L, 4L, 3L, 3L, 3L )
attributes(x) <- list(class="factor", 
                      levels=c("Sunny",
                              "Mostly Sunny",
                              "Mostly Cloudy",
                              "AM Showers"))
x
```
